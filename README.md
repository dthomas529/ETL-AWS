## Project title: Batch Event Driven Data Processing
Link were the app is hosted
## Task: Retrieve a file uploaded to S3 bucket.
## Criteria:  
  ## Created storage
  ## Write code
  ## Write lambda function
  ## Deploy function
  ## Test function
## Summary: I used Python and VS Code to write the code because this is the backend language that I’m studying.  Then, using my AWS account,  I created an AWS Lambda Function because I want the function to automatically run the code when the function is triggered.
## Functionality: When a file is uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket, the Lambda Function is triggered. Using boto3, which integrates Python with AWS services, the function locates the bucket and key, using indexing. The function retrieves the file and prints its contents.
## Run locally: 
  ## Run this command: git clone https:://…git
  ## Run npm install
  ## Double check your ports …that can usually cause errors
  ## Run npm run start-dev
  # #You are now in the development environment
## Tech Stack:
  ## Python
  ## VS Code
  ## AWS S3
  ## AWS Lambda Function
